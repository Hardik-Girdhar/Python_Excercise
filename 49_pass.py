# The code is supposed to get some input from the user, but instead, it produces an error. Please try to understand the error and then fix it.

pass = input("Please enter your password: ") 

# Answer: 
pass1 = input("Please enter your password: ") 

# Explanation:
# There was a SyntaxError  error because the syntax to name the variable was wrong since pass  is a reserved keyword in Python.
# However, you can solve that by adding a number to the name or simply choosing another variable name.
