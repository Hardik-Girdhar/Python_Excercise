# Question: The script is supposed to print out the letter "e" if the letter is in the string "Hello," but it doesn't. Please try to fix the script.

# for letter in "Hello":
#     if letter == "e":
#     print(letter)

# Expected output:
# e 

# Answer: 
for letter in "Hello":
    if letter == "e":
        print(letter)
      
# Explanation:
# The solution was to indent the print statement because you always indent the line under an if  statement.
